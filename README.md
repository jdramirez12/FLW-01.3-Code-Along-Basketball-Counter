## FLW 01.3 // Code Along // Basketball Score Counter

Your school needs a website to keep track of scores during basketball games. There's some variables that need to be written and some that need to be updated in order to work!


## Code Along, Part 1: 

Go to the JS file and find task 1 and 2.
1. [ ] Declare two variables: one called `team1Name`  and another called `team2Name`.
</br>

2. [ ] Save the class of these HTML elements using querySelector and the correct class names.
    - Note: not sure what the class names are? Check out the HTML.
</br>
</br>

3. [ ] Next, we need to update our variables for each throw with the correct amount of points!
    - Replace the quotes with the correct amounts.
    - `twoPoints` should equal 2
    - `threePoints` should equal 3
    - `freeThrow` should equal 1
</br>
</br>

4. [ ] Test out the buttons!
